# R_ACS_Mapping

This project contains R code adapted from a program originally for a work project. This code maps median household income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) across New York City. Here I create a few static and interactive maps using different packages. 

Key Packages:
- tidycensus
- tigris
- ggplot2
- leaflet
- ggiraph

Note: Due to the current Trump administration, this code no longer runs as of 01/31/2025. The census page that stores TIGER shapefiles has been deleted and/or archived (https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/).
