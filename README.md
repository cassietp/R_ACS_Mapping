# R_ACS_Mapping

This project contains R code adapted from a program originally created for a work project. This code maps median household income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) across New York City. Here I create a few static and interactive maps using different packages. 

Key Packages:
- tidycensus
- tigris
- ggplot2
- leaflet
- ggiraph

Directory:
- ACS_Map_Sample250203_Git.Rmd is the R Markdown file (without rendered output)
- https://cassietp.github.io/R_ACS_Mapping/ is the Github Page that contains the code and full output (all map figures)
  - docs folder contains the html file that was used to create the GitHub page
